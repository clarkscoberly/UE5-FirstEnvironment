# UE5-FirstEnvironment

## Overview

I have always been fascinated by video games, the world that people are able to create with effectively 1's and 0's. It has been a long time goal of mine to realize my own world within a space and be able to say that my mind was able to help create that. This project of mine was a realization of this goal and just how far I still have to go to understand the world of environment design.

What I was able to create was an environment contained within Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) a first in a portion of the field that always looked so daunting.
